/* ============================================================
   DASHBOARD WORKER (Cloudflare Worker)

   Three unrelated jobs live here, all because they need something
   server-side that GitHub Pages (pure static hosting) can't do:

   1. THERUNDOWN PROXY — TheRundown's API key is personal to your
      account and must never ship in client-side JS (unlike
      TheSportsDB's old public "123" test key) — see
      https://docs.therundown.io/authentication. This holds that key
      server-side as a secret and forwards a small allowlist of
      read-only requests to TheRundown on the dashboard's behalf.

   2. LEAGUE FACTS STORE — the "who won the FA Cup" style facts, manual
      point adjustments, and regular-season locks (js/season-lock.js)
      marked/computed from the dashboard need to be visible to everyone
      looking at the dashboard, not just saved in one person's browser
      (localStorage can't do that). This stores one JSON blob per
      league (three flavors: facts, adjustments, and lock) in Workers
      KV and hands it back to whoever asks. Reads (GET) stay open to
      anyone — every drafter needs to see current facts/adjustments/
      lock state. Writes (PUT) require the X-Admin-Password header to
      match the ADMIN_PASSWORD secret — basic, shared-secret protection
      appropriate for a friend-group
      app, not real per-user auth.

   3. FAVORITES STORE — a lightweight sibling to League Facts above:
      one JSON array of team keys per drafter (js/favorites.js), so a
      favorited team follows that drafter across devices instead of
      living in one browser's localStorage. Unlike League Facts/
      Adjustments, writes are deliberately left open, no
      X-Admin-Password — a drafter's own favorites list isn't shared
      scoring data, so it doesn't need the same protection, and
      requiring the admin password just to star a team would be the
      wrong trust tier for it.

   4. THESPORTSDB PROXY — once on the premium tier, the API key is a
      real paid credential (unlike the free "123" key, which is
      public and meant to be embedded client-side) and must never
      ship in client-side JS either. Forwards a small allowlist of
      team/schedule requests to TheSportsDB's V2 API (header auth,
      https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v2/json) on the dashboard's
      behalf, plus one V1 (key embedded in the URL path, like the old
      free key) admin route for one-off league lookups. The league
      TABLE route that used to live here (V1's lookuptable.php, for
      EPL standings) is retired — EPL standings moved to ESPN's hidden
      API (js/espn.js), which is CORS-open and needs no proxy at all.
      See docs/espn-migration-plan.md.

   EDGE CACHING — every proxied GET is cached in Workers' shared edge
   cache (caches.default), keyed on the upstream URL alone, with a TTL
   matched to how fast that data actually changes (see CACHE_TTL_SECONDS
   below). This exists because the client-side TTLs in js/api.js and js/standings-epl.js only
   protect a single browser: with several drafters loading the dashboard
   at once (e.g. everyone checking scores during a Saturday college
   football slate), each browser was independently re-hitting TheRundown
   on its own schedule, multiplying real upstream calls by however many
   tabs were open. That's how 36 "requests" blew a 20,000/day data-point
   budget in one sitting — this collapses concurrent/near-concurrent
   requests for the same data into one upstream fetch, shared by everyone.

/* ---- Adding a new league or upstream endpoint: keep this scalable ----
   1. If the credential behind it is private/paid (not a public test
      key like TheSportsDB's old "123"), it MUST be proxied through
      this Worker, never shipped in client JS — add a new proxyTo/
      handle function pair mirroring the ones below.
   2. Every new upstream fetch MUST go through cachedUpstreamFetch, not
      a bare fetch() — add its TTL to CACHE_TTL_SECONDS below rather
      than hardcoding a number inline. Pick that TTL to match whatever
      TTL you're also about to use client-side (see the matching
      checklist next to RUNDOWN_CACHE_TTL_MS in js/api.js) — one
      freshness decision, not two that can quietly drift apart.
   3. Add the new league's key to KNOWN_LEAGUES only if it needs the
      League Facts feature (shared cross-viewer marks) — most new
      leagues won't need this on day one.
   4. If an endpoint's real response shape is unverified (no confirmed
      docs, or docs that don't match reality — see the V1/V2 standings
      note above), curl it directly with a real key and confirm the
      shape before any client code gets built against it. */
