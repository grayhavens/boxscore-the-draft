/* ============================================================
   NBA Standings: real conference standings (East/West), each nested
   with a real Division breakdown (Atlantic/Central/Southeast/
   Northwest/Pacific/Southwest — see fetchEspnNbaDivisionStandings in
   js/espn.js), plus each drafter's combined win percentage across
   their 3 NBA teams — this league had NO standings source at all
   before ESPN (TheSportsDB's free/V1 tier has never carried real NBA
   standings), so unlike EPL/CFB/NFL this isn't replacing a shakier
   existing source, it's turning on a tab that previously just said "No
   data available."
   Shares its cache/toggle/render engine with NHL/MLB — see
   createFlatStandingsBoard in js/standings-flat.js for what's generic
   and what's sport-specific below. (WNBA used to be the 4th league
   here too; it now has its own flat, EPL-style module instead — see
   js/standings-wnba.js.)
