   LIVE DATA: TheSportsDB v1 API
   Using the public free test key "123" — rate-limited to 30
   requests/min. Each team's data is cached in memory (and mirrored to
   localStorage — see LIVE_DATA_CACHE_KEY in js/live-data.js) after its
   first fetch and refreshed on a staggered background schedule (see
   js/live-data.js) rather than re-fetched on every click, so opening a
   team you've already viewed is instant, even across browser sessions.
   If you upgrade to a premium key later (thesportsdb.com,
   ~$9/mo), just swap the "123" below for your own key.

   DASHBOARD WORKER: shared Cloudflare Worker — see
   worker/rundown-proxy.js for the two things it does:

   1. Proxies a handful of TheRundown requests (its API key can't be
      embedded in client JS the way TheSportsDB's public test key
      can). TheRundown supplements — never replaces — TheSportsDB:
      it adds live in-game state (score/clock while a match is
      actually in progress), which TheSportsDB's free tier doesn't
      have. Only teams with a rundownTeamId set in js/data.js (see
      RUNDOWN_SPORT_ID below for which leagues that covers so far)
      get this; everyone else is untouched.
   2. Stores the League Facts data (see js/league-facts.js) in Workers
      KV so a mark made by one drafter is visible to everyone, instead
      of sitting in just their own browser's localStorage.

   Leave DASHBOARD_WORKER_BASE empty to turn both off — the
   TheRundown lookups become a no-op (teams fall back to their
   existing TheSportsDB-only display) and League Facts falls back to
   localStorage-only (not shared, but still functional).

/* ---- Adding a new league or per-team data source: keep this scalable ----
   The patterns below (rundownDayCache right after this comment,
   eplStandingsCache in js/standings-epl.js, LIVE_TEAM_KEYS/
   backgroundRefreshTick in js/live-data.js) are deliberate, not
   incidental — follow them for anything new rather than reinventing a
   fetch path:

   1. Data shared by every team in a league (a day's slate, a standings
      table) belongs in ONE cache keyed by leagueKey (+date, if it's
      date-scoped) — mirror rundownDayCache / eplStandingsCache. Never
      let each team fetch and store its own copy of the same
      league-wide payload; that's what turns "add 27 more CFB teams"
      into "27 more calls" instead of zero.
   2. Data that's genuinely per-team and slow-moving (full schedule,
      last result, next fixture) rides the existing staggered refresh
      loop (LIVE_TEAM_KEYS/backgroundRefreshTick) — don't add a second
      loop for this. The one deliberate exception is
      liveScoreboardSweepTick (js/live-data.js): a fast, separate loop
      that re-patches just the live/final score line across every team
      at once, off the same per-league scoreboard cache the rotation
      already shares — added because that one field (unlike everything
      else here) genuinely needs to update faster than "once per team's
      turn in a 5-minute cycle" to feel live, and re-fetching every
      team's full schedule that often would be pure waste. If you're
      tempted to add a second loop for anything else, it almost
      certainly belongs in the existing rotation instead — this
      exception is narrow on purpose.
      Note: the old "bump SPORTSDB_CALLS_PER_TEAM_TICK so REFRESH_CYCLE_MS
      keeps stretching out" advice that used to live here is gone along
      with those constants — per docs/espn-migration-plan.md ("SportsDB
      fully deprecated"), nothing in normal operation calls TheSportsDB
      anymore, and ESPN has no observed rate limit, so there's no metered
      per-tick budget left to protect. MIN_REFRESH_CYCLE_MS in
      js/live-data.js is now a plain product choice, not a budget
      calculation — see its own comment before changing it.
   3. Anything that should survive a reload goes in its own per-entity
      localStorage key (prefix + id), not one growing blob — mirror
      LIVE_DATA_CACHE_PREFIX / TEAM_INFO_CACHE_PREFIX in js/live-data.js.
   4. Pick each cache's TTL to match how fast that data actually
      changes (static info -> hours, live scores -> ~1min, standings ->
      ~15min) — and use that SAME number for CACHE_TTL_SECONDS on
      whichever Worker endpoint backs it (see worker/rundown-proxy.js),
      so the two layers agree on freshness instead of each guessing
      separately.
   5. If a league's data shape or endpoint is unverified, pilot it on
      2-3 teams and diff against a known-good source before rolling it
      out league-wide — same approach EPL's V1->V2 migration used (see
      V2_MIGRATED_LEAGUES below).
   6. If the credential behind it is private/paid (not a public test
      key), it MUST be proxied through the Worker, never shipped in
      client JS — see the Worker-side checklist in
      worker/rundown-proxy.js next to CACHE_TTL_SECONDS. */

// A day's full slate for a league rarely changes within a few

// else stays on V1 until their league's batch lands, verified against
// real data first. EPL is fully migrated (Phase 2 piloted it on
// Liverpool/Newcastle, side-by-side-diffed against V1, then the rest
// of the league followed once that checked out). CFB followed the same
// pattern: piloted against the live worker on Oregon (both directions
// of the schedule endpoint returned correct real results/fixtures,
// field-for-field matching V1's shape) plus a handful of others
// (Texas A&M, Arizona, Ohio State, Georgia) before batching in the
// rest of the league — CFB's V1 path was CORS-blocked from the
// browser anyway, so this also fixes Last Result/Next Game actually
// populating for these teams. Remove this list entirely (and the V1
// branch it feeds) once every league has migrated — Phase 4.
//
// IMPORTANT — this only matters for NBA/NHL/MLB/WNBA/College BB, the
// leagues still on V1 from before the premium key existed. Any LEAGUE
// ADDED FROM NOW ON must be wired straight onto V2 (added here
// immediately, never left on the V1 branch to "migrate later")
// — we're paying for the premium SportsDB key specifically so new
// integrations don't inherit V1's free-tier CORS breakage (the exact
// bug that left CFB's Last Result/Next Game blank until this migration).
// NFL followed the same pilot-then-batch approach CFB used: piloted on
// Detroit/Pittsburgh/Miami, confirmed real results/fixtures came back
// in the same shape, then the rest of the roster followed.
